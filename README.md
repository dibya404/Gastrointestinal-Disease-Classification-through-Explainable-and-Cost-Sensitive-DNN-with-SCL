## Pre-trained Models
The pre-trained models that have been used are mentioned below-
* ResNet50
* EfficientNet
* DenseNet
* Inception
* Xception

## Code
The "Code" folder contains the code of this project. Specific libraries, that are mentioned in the Notebook, are needed to be installed to run the code. The "Code" folder consists of "Contrastive Learning" and "Contrastive Learning with Cost-Sensitive Approach" folder. 
* "Contrastive Learning" folder contains the implementation code of above-mentioned pre-trained models with contrastive learning. 
* "Contrastive Learning with Cost-Sensitive Approach" folder comprises the code of cost-sensitive pre-trained Xception model with supervised contrastive learning.

## Data
